# Intelligent Flying Machines 
We make humans as efficient as robots.

At the core, IFM is a Data Analytics Company using Machine Learning,
Computer Vision, and Robotics to automate indoor data capture. We develop
autonomous systems that know where they are and what they see using no
external infrastructure.

IFM works with customers across automotive manufacturing and logistics to
improve their operational efficiency through the deployment of these
systems. Our first product automates inventory checking in warehouses with
flying robots.

## what we look for
We look for elegantly written, maintainable, and reusable code. We want you to leverage test-driven principles that quantify your implementation's performance.
